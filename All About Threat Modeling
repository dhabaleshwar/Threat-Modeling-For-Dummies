# Introduction
Threat modeling is a way of identifying and prioritizing potential threats to a system (like a computer program or network) and figuring out how to reduce or neutralize those threats. It helps us understand where the system might be vulnerable and how to protect it.
Here are some important terms to know:

1. Threat agent: This refers to the person or group that has the ability to carry out a threat. We need to identify who might want to attack the system, how they would do it, and if they have the capability to do so.

2. Impact: Impact measures the potential damage caused by a threat. It can include physical damage, financial loss, harm to a company's reputation, or loss of user trust. Some threats may have indirect consequences that need to be considered too.

3. Likelihood: Likelihood is the possibility of a threat happening. Factors like the difficulty of carrying out the threat and the potential reward for the attacker affect the likelihood. If it's hard to carry out the threat or the reward is low, the likelihood is low. But if it's easier to attack or the attacker stands to gain valuable information, the likelihood is higher.

4. Controls: Controls are safeguards or countermeasures we put in place to protect the system from threats. There are two types:
   - Preventions: These controls completely prevent a specific attack from happening. For example, removing certain application logging to avoid exposing users' personal information.
   - Mitigations: These controls reduce the likelihood or impact of a threat without completely preventing it. For instance, adding salts to user passwords to make them harder to crack.

Now, let's talk about some key concepts:

1. Data flow diagram: This is a visual representation of how information flows through a system. It shows where data is input or output, and where it is stored temporarily or permanently.

2. Trust boundary: A trust boundary is a point on the data flow diagram where data changes its level of trust. It's usually where data is passed between different processes or subsystems. For example, when your application reads a file from disk, there's a trust boundary between the application and the file because the file can be modified by external processes or users.

In threat modeling, we create a threat model by following these steps:

1. Document how data flows through the system to identify possible attack points.
2. Identify and document as many potential threats to the system as possible.
3. Document security controls that can be implemented to reduce the likelihood or impact of those threats.

Remember, threat modeling should be done by everyone involved in software development, not just security experts. It's important to include threat modeling early in the development process to save resources and address risks effectively.

By understanding potential threats and implementing appropriate controls, we can protect our systems, applications, and user data from harm.
