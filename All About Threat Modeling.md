# Introduction
Threat modeling is a way of identifying and prioritizing potential threats to a system (like a computer program or network) and figuring out how to reduce or neutralize those threats. It helps us understand where the system might be vulnerable and how to protect it. Think of Threat modeling as playing detective to find potential problems and protect a system, like a computer program or network. 

Here are some important terms to know:

**1. Threat agent:** This refers to the person or group that has the ability to carry out a threat. We need to identify who might want to attack the system, how they would do it, and if they have the capability to do so. Think of a threat agent as a "bad guy" who could attack the system. It could be a person or a group with the ability to cause harm.

**2. Impact:** Impact measures the potential damage caused by a threat. It can include physical damage, financial loss, harm to a company's reputation, or loss of user trust. Some threats may have indirect consequences that need to be considered too.

**3. Likelihood:** Likelihood is the possibility of a threat happening. Factors like the difficulty of carrying out the threat and the potential reward for the attacker affect the likelihood. If it's hard to carry out the threat or the reward is low, the likelihood is low. But if it's easier to attack or the attacker stands to gain valuable information, the likelihood is higher.

**4. Controls:** Controls are safeguards or countermeasures we put in place to protect the system from threats. There are two types:
   - Preventions: These controls completely prevent a specific attack from happening. For example, removing certain application logging to avoid exposing users' personal information.
   - Mitigations: These controls reduce the likelihood or impact of a threat without completely preventing it. For instance, adding salts to user passwords to make them harder to crack.

Now, let's talk about some key concepts:

**1. Data flow diagram:** This is a visual representation of how information flows through a system. It shows where data is input or output, and where it is stored temporarily or permanently.

**2. Trust boundary:** A trust boundary is a point on the data flow diagram where data changes its level of trust. It's usually where data is passed between different processes or subsystems. Think of it as a "safety line" where we know the data is safe. When data crosses this line, we need to be careful because it could be changed or manipulated by others. For example, when your application reads a file from disk, there's a trust boundary between the application and the file because the file can be modified by external processes or users.

In threat modeling, we create a threat model by following these steps:
```
1. Document how data flows through the system to identify possible attack points.
2. Identify and document as many potential threats to the system as possible.
3. Document security controls that can be implemented to reduce the likelihood or impact of those threats.
```
Threat modeling should be done by everyone involved in software development, not just security experts. It's important to include threat modeling early in the development process to save resources and address risks effectively. By understanding potential threats and implementing appropriate controls, we can protect our systems, applications, and user data from harm.
# Let's Get Started


## Define Business Objectives
Before starting threat modeling, it's important to understand the goals and requirements of the application or system you're assessing. This includes considering what the application aims to achieve for the business and any security or compliance regulations that need to be followed.

Example: Let's say you're assessing a shopping website. The business objective is to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for customers to browse and purchase products.

## Identify Application Design 
To perform threat modeling, you need to understand how the application is designed. This involves creating a diagram that shows how data flows within the system and identifying trust boundaries (where data changes its level of trust). Understanding the design helps assess the likelihood and impact of potential threats.

Example: In the shopping website example, the design would include how users input their information, how the website handles payment transactions, and how data is stored and protected.

## Create Design Documents
Design documents help document and communicate the application's design. One approach is the 4+1 view model, which provides different perspectives on the system's architecture. The views include:

**- Logical View:** Describes the application's object model and how it functions from a functional standpoint. It focuses on the system's behavior and relationships between components.

Example: In the shopping website, the logical view would outline the different parts of the website, such as the product catalog, shopping cart, and user account management.

**- Implementation View:** Focuses on the software components and how they are organized in layers or subsystems. It helps programmers understand how to build the application.

Example: The implementation view would show how the different software components, like the front-end interface and the back-end server, work together.

**- Process View:** Describes the non-functional aspects of the design, such as how the system handles concurrency and synchronization. It helps integrators understand how the different parts of the system interact.

Example: The process view would show how multiple users can interact with the website simultaneously and how the system handles their requests.

**- Deployment View:** Focuses on the physical infrastructure and shows how the software is deployed on hardware. It helps deployment managers understand how to set up and maintain the system.

Example: The deployment view would show how the website is hosted on servers and how those servers are connected.

**- Use-Case View:** Describes the central functionality of the system through specific scenarios or use cases. It helps all stakeholders, including end users, understand the system's purpose and features.

Example: The use-case view would outline scenarios like searching for products, adding items to the cart, and completing a purchase.

By using the 4+1 view model , everyone involved in building the software can have a better understanding of how the system works from different perspectives. It helps in communication, identifying potential issues, and making sure the system meets the requirements of users and stakeholders.
## Decomposing and Modeling The System
To perform threat modeling, it's important to understand how a system works and how it interacts with its surroundings. Here are some steps to help you decompose and model the system:

1- Start by creating a high-level diagram that shows the flow of information in the system. Identify the different parts of the system, like applications or modules, and how they connect with each other.

2- Identify the trusted boundaries of the system. These are the points where the system interacts with external entities. For example, if you're looking at a website, the trusted boundary could be where the website interacts with user input.

3- Add actors to the diagram. Actors can be both internal and external entities that interact with the system. Internal actors could be users or administrators, while external actors could be attackers or other systems.

4- Define internal trusted boundaries within the system. These are the different security zones or compartments that have been designed to protect certain parts of the system.

5- Review the actors you identified earlier to make sure they align with the trusted boundaries and the overall system design.

6- Add information flows to the diagram. These represent how data or information moves between different parts of the system. For example, it could be the flow of user input from a web form to a database.

7- Identify the information elements and classify them based on your information classification policy. This means categorizing the information based on its sensitivity or importance. For example, personal user data may be classified as highly sensitive.

8- Where possible, add assets to the identified information flows. Assets are the valuable resources that need protection, such as databases, servers, or intellectual property. This helps you identify what needs to be safeguarded.

## Define and Evaluate your Assets

In the context of threat modeling, assets refer to the valuable resources within a system or organization. These assets can include sensitive data, intellectual property, infrastructure components, or anything else that holds value. It is important to define and evaluate these assets based on their confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Example: In a cybersecurity context, assets can include customer data, financial information, proprietary software code, or critical infrastructure components like servers or network devices. Evaluating the value of these assets helps prioritize security measures and allocate resources effectively.

## Consider Data in transit and Data at rest
Data in transit refers to information that is being transmitted over networks or transferred between different devices. Data at rest, on the other hand, refers to information that is stored or saved on storage devices, servers, or databases. Protecting both data in transit and data at rest is crucial to maintain the security of sensitive information.

Example: When you send an email, the data being transmitted from your device to the email server is data in transit. Encrypting the email using secure protocols ensures that it cannot be intercepted and read by unauthorized individuals. Similarly, when you store files on your computer's hard drive, they become data at rest. Implementing encryption or access controls to protect the files from unauthorized access safeguards the data.

## Create an information flow diagram
An information flow diagram is a visual representation of how data moves within a system. It shows how information is processed, transferred, and accessed by different components or entities within the system.

Example: In a typical e-commerce website, an information flow diagram would depict how user inputs, such as product orders or payment information, flow through the web application, database, and payment gateway. Understanding this flow helps identify potential points of vulnerability and implement security measures to protect the data during its journey.

## Whiteboard Your Architecture
Whiteboarding the system architecture means drawing a simplified diagram that highlights the main components, constraints, and decisions of the system. It helps provide a clear overview and facilitates communication among stakeholders.

Example: Imagine you are designing a mobile banking application. Whiteboarding the architecture would involve sketching out the user interface, the server infrastructure, and the connection between them. This visual representation helps everyone involved understand the overall structure and functionalities of the application.

## Manage to present your DFD in the context of MVC
When creating a Data Flow Diagram (DFD), it can be helpful to divide it into the context of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. MVC separates the system into three components: the model (data and logic), the view (user interface), and the controller (handles user input and manages the interaction between the model and view).

Example: In the context of an e-commerce website, the model component would represent the product catalog and inventory management, the view component would be the web pages that users see, and the controller component would handle the shopping cart functionality and order processing. Organizing the DFD in this way helps understand the system's functionality and potential security risks associated with each component.

## Use tools to draw your diagram
There are various tools available that can assist in creating the information flow diagram or DFD. These tools provide features and templates to visualize the system's architecture and highlight potential threats.

Example: OWASP Threat Dragon, Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT), and OWASP PYTM are examples of tools that help in creating threat model diagrams. These tools offer functionalities to record threats, identify mitigations, and generate visual representations of the system's architecture and associated risks.

## Define Data Flow over your DFD
When defining the data flow in the DFD, you need to identify how information moves within the organization or system.

This includes understanding the sources, destinations, and transformations of data throughout its lifecycle.

Example: In the context of an online banking system, the data flow could include user login information, transaction details, and account balances. Mapping out the data flow helps identify potential security vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access or data leakage, at each stage of the process.

## Define Trust Boundaries
Trust boundaries represent the points within a system where trust is established or boundaries between different levels of trust. Defining these boundaries helps identify areas where security controls and measures should be enforced.

Example: In a corporate network, a trust boundary may exist between the internal network and the external internet. The internal network is considered more trusted, and access to resources outside the network requires additional security measures such as firewalls or access controls to protect against external threats.

## Define applications user roles and trust levels
In this step, you define different user roles and their corresponding levels of trust within the system. User roles determine the privileges and access rights granted to individuals or entities using the application.

Example: In an online shopping website, user roles can include regular customers, administrators, and guest users. Each role has different levels of access and permissions within the system. For instance, administrators have higher privileges to manage product listings and customer data, while guest users may have limited access for browsing products.

## Highlight Authorization per user role over the DFD
This step involves specifying the authorization or permissions granted to different user roles within the system. It ensures that only authorized individuals can access and perform specific actions based on their assigned roles.

Example: In an educational institution's student information system, different user roles could include students, teachers, and administrative staff. Each role would have different levels of authorization, with students having access to their own grades and assignments, teachers being able to enter grades, and administrators having broader administrative privileges.

## Define Application Entry points
Application entry points are the interfaces or channels through which potential attackers can interact with the application or introduce malicious data or commands.

Example: For a web-based application, entry points could include web forms, login screens, or API endpoints. Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in these entry points to gain unauthorized access or inject malicious code.

## Identify Threat Agents
Threat agents are individuals, groups, or entities that pose a threat to the system or organization. It is important to identify all possible threat agents that could exist within the system and understand their means, motives, and opportunities to carry out attacks. This helps in associating threat agents with specific system components they can directly interact with.

Example: Threat agents can include hackers, malicious insiders, organized crime groups, or nation-state actors. For instance, a hacker may have the means (technical skills), motive (financial gain or revenge), and opportunity (weak security controls) to launch a cyber attack against a company's website.

## Minimize the number of threat agents
To simplify threat modeling, it is useful to treat similar threat agents as equivalent classes. This reduces the complexity of assessing threats and allows for more efficient analysis. Additionally, considering the motivation of the attackers can help evaluate the likelihood of specific threats occurring.

Example: Instead of individually analyzing every hacker or insider threat, grouping them into categories such as "external hackers" or "privileged insiders" can streamline the threat assessment process. By understanding the motivations behind these threat agents, such as financial gain or espionage, it becomes easier to prioritize potential threats.

## Consider insider threats
Insider threats refer to risks posed by individuals who have authorized access to an organization's systems or information. These individuals may intentionally or unintentionally cause harm to the organization's assets.

Example: An employee with legitimate access to sensitive customer data may misuse that access to steal personal information or sell it to third parties. Such insider threats can be challenging to detect because the individuals already have authorized access, making it important to implement appropriate controls and monitoring mechanisms.

## Map threat agents to application entry points
Mapping threat agents to application entry points involves identifying which entry points, such as login processes or registration forms, could be targeted by specific threat agents.

Example: A threat agent like an external hacker may target the login process of an e-commerce website to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. By mapping this threat agent to the specific entry point, the focus can be placed on securing the login mechanism and implementing measures like multi-factor authentication or account lockouts to mitigate the risk.

## Draw attack vectors and attacks tree
Creating attack vectors and attacks tree diagrams helps visualize potential attack paths and understand how an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the system.

Example: An attack vector could involve a hacker exploiting a web application vulnerability, gaining unauthorized access to the application's database, and extracting sensitive customer information. Understanding such attack vectors allows security teams to prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts and implement proper security controls at each step.

## Mapping abuse cases to use cases
Mapping abuse cases to use cases involves identifying potential threats or malicious actions that can occur within each intended use case of the application. This helps identify application logical threats.

Example: In an online banking system, abuse cases could include actions like tampering with transaction amounts, bypassing authorization checks, or manipulating account balances. By mapping these abuse cases to use cases, vulnerabilities can be identified and appropriate security measures can be implemented.

## Re-define attack vectors
After defining attack vectors, it is important to consider the potential consequences of a compromised user role and re-define the attack vectors accordingly. This accounts for the cascading effects of an initial compromise.

Example: If an attacker gains access to an administrative user account in a system, they may have additional privileges to perform actions that can lead to further attacks. These attack vectors need to be re-defined to address the expanded capabilities of the compromised account.

## Write your Threat traceability matrix
A threat traceability matrix helps document the identified threats and their associated risks. It provides a structured overview of the threats, allowing for better risk management and mitigation planning.

Example: The matrix would include a list of identified threats, their potential impact on the system or organization, and the probability of occurrence. It helps prioritize and allocate resources to address the most critical threats.

## Define the Impact and Probability for each threat
Determining the impact and probability of each threat involves assessing the potential consequences and the likelihood of the threat materializing. This helps in understanding the overall risk level associated with each threat.

Example: For a threat like a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on a website, the impact could be significant service disruption and loss of revenue, while the probability may vary based on factors like the website's visibility and the prevalence of DDoS attacks in the industry.

## Use risk management methodology
Risk management methodologies, such as DREAD and PASTA, provide frameworks for evaluating and addressing risks associated with identified threats. These methodologies help prioritize risks and allocate appropriate resources for mitigation.

Example:

- DREAD: DREAD is a method that assigns risk values based on factors like the potential damage, reproducibility, exploitability, affected users, and discoverability of a vulnerability. The calculated risk value helps determine the risk level.

- PASTA: PASTA is a risk-centric methodology that focuses on application threat modeling. It emphasizes early evaluation of the impact of threats and vulnerabilities. The methodology aims to apply security countermeasures based on the potential impact that could be sustained from defined threat models, vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and attack patterns.

- STRIDE: STRIDE is a framework used in threat modeling to identify and analyze potential threats to a system or application. It helps developers and security professionals think about different types of threats that can occur. The components include spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation of privilege.

Now let's learn each of them in detail.
## DREAD
DREAD is a risk assessment methodology that helps evaluate vulnerabilities by using a mathematical formula to calculate the corresponding risk. It considers five main categories: Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability.

Damage: It assesses the potential impact or harm that an attack exploiting the vulnerability can cause. The higher the potential damage, the greater the risk.

Reproducibility: It evaluates how easy it is to reproduce the attack. If an attack can be easily replicated, the risk increases.

Exploitability: It measures the effort required to launch the attack. The higher the effort, the lower the risk.

Affected users: It considers the number of users or systems that would be impacted by the attack. More affected users indicate a higher risk level.

Discoverability: It assesses how easy it is to discover the vulnerability. If it is easily detectable, the risk may be lower.

The DREAD formula calculates the risk value as follows:
Risk Value = (Damage + Affected users) x (Reproducibility + Exploitability + Discoverability).

Based on the calculated risk value, organizations can determine the risk level and prioritize their mitigation efforts.
## PASTA
PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) is a comprehensive methodology for application threat modeling. It focuses on evaluating risks and applying appropriate security countermeasures based on the possible impact that could result from defined threat models, vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and attack patterns.

In PASTA, impact analysis is performed early in the analysis phase, before evaluating the risk. This is done to ensure that the consequences of potential failures in the product or use cases are properly understood by the stakeholders.

PASTA follows a risk-centric approach and includes the following steps:

Identifying threats: Identifying potential threats that the application might face.

Evaluating impact: Assessing the impact of threats on the system or organization.

Analyzing risks: Evaluating the risk level for each identified threat based on impact and other factors.

Applying countermeasures: Implementing security countermeasures that are commensurate with the identified risks.

PASTA emphasizes contextual evaluation of threat impacts, considering the probability and effectiveness of countermeasures in the specific scenario. It provides a structured methodology for assessing and addressing risks in application security.

By following PASTA, organizations can gain a better understanding of the risks associated with their applications and make informed decisions about implementing appropriate security measures.
## STRIDE-LM
STRIDE is a framework used in threat modeling to identify and analyze potential threats to a system or application. It helps developers and security professionals think about different types of threats that can occur. Here's a simple explanation of each component of STRIDE:

- Spoofing: This is when someone pretends to be someone else to gain unauthorized access. It's like someone wearing a disguise to fool others into thinking they are someone they're not.

- Tampering: Tampering refers to unauthorized changes or modifications to data or systems. It's like someone secretly altering the contents of a document without anyone noticing.

- Repudiation: Repudiation is when someone denies doing something that they actually did. It's like a person claiming they didn't send an email when there is evidence that they did.

- Information disclosure: Information disclosure occurs when sensitive or confidential information is revealed to unauthorized individuals. It's like accidentally sharing your password with someone who shouldn't have access to it.

- Denial of Service (DoS): Denial of Service attacks aim to make a system or network unavailable to its intended users. It's like someone overwhelming a phone line with so many calls that nobody else can get through.

- Elevation of privilege: Elevation of privilege involves gaining unauthorized access to higher levels of privilege or permissions. It's like a regular user suddenly obtaining administrative rights and being able to control everything.

Practitioners at Lockheed Martin noted that STRIDE was developed primarily to address engineering and development projects, rather than network defense. To make the model more applicable to the latter, they added a seventh classification:

Lateral Movement – Expanding control over the target network beyond the initial point of compromise.

By considering these types of threats, developers and security experts can identify potential vulnerabilities and take appropriate measures to protect against them. The goal is to understand how these threats can impact a system's security and then implement countermeasures to prevent or mitigate them.
