# Introduction
Threat modeling is a way of identifying and prioritizing potential threats to a system (like a computer program or network) and figuring out how to reduce or neutralize those threats. It helps us understand where the system might be vulnerable and how to protect it. Think of Threat modeling as playing detective to find potential problems and protect a system, like a computer program or network. 

Here are some important terms to know:

**1. Threat agent:** This refers to the person or group that has the ability to carry out a threat. We need to identify who might want to attack the system, how they would do it, and if they have the capability to do so. Think of a threat agent as a "bad guy" who could attack the system. It could be a person or a group with the ability to cause harm.

**2. Impact:** Impact measures the potential damage caused by a threat. It can include physical damage, financial loss, harm to a company's reputation, or loss of user trust. Some threats may have indirect consequences that need to be considered too.

**3. Likelihood:** Likelihood is the possibility of a threat happening. Factors like the difficulty of carrying out the threat and the potential reward for the attacker affect the likelihood. If it's hard to carry out the threat or the reward is low, the likelihood is low. But if it's easier to attack or the attacker stands to gain valuable information, the likelihood is higher.

**4. Controls:** Controls are safeguards or countermeasures we put in place to protect the system from threats. There are two types:
   - Preventions: These controls completely prevent a specific attack from happening. For example, removing certain application logging to avoid exposing users' personal information.
   - Mitigations: These controls reduce the likelihood or impact of a threat without completely preventing it. For instance, adding salts to user passwords to make them harder to crack.

Now, let's talk about some key concepts:

**1. Data flow diagram:** This is a visual representation of how information flows through a system. It shows where data is input or output, and where it is stored temporarily or permanently.

**2. Trust boundary:** A trust boundary is a point on the data flow diagram where data changes its level of trust. It's usually where data is passed between different processes or subsystems. Think of it as a "safety line" where we know the data is safe. When data crosses this line, we need to be careful because it could be changed or manipulated by others. For example, when your application reads a file from disk, there's a trust boundary between the application and the file because the file can be modified by external processes or users.

In threat modeling, we create a threat model by following these steps:
```
1. Document how data flows through the system to identify possible attack points.
2. Identify and document as many potential threats to the system as possible.
3. Document security controls that can be implemented to reduce the likelihood or impact of those threats.
```
Threat modeling should be done by everyone involved in software development, not just security experts. It's important to include threat modeling early in the development process to save resources and address risks effectively. By understanding potential threats and implementing appropriate controls, we can protect our systems, applications, and user data from harm.
# Let's Get Started


## Define Business Objectives
Before starting threat modeling, it's important to understand the goals and requirements of the application or system you're assessing. This includes considering what the application aims to achieve for the business and any security or compliance regulations that need to be followed.

Example: Let's say you're assessing a shopping website. The business objective is to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for customers to browse and purchase products.

## Identify Application Design 
To perform threat modeling, you need to understand how the application is designed. This involves creating a diagram that shows how data flows within the system and identifying trust boundaries (where data changes its level of trust). Understanding the design helps assess the likelihood and impact of potential threats.

Example: In the shopping website example, the design would include how users input their information, how the website handles payment transactions, and how data is stored and protected.

## Create Design Documents
Design documents help document and communicate the application's design. One approach is the 4+1 view model, which provides different perspectives on the system's architecture. The views include:

**- Logical View:** Describes the application's object model and how it functions from a functional standpoint. It focuses on the system's behavior and relationships between components.

Example: In the shopping website, the logical view would outline the different parts of the website, such as the product catalog, shopping cart, and user account management.

**- Implementation View:** Focuses on the software components and how they are organized in layers or subsystems. It helps programmers understand how to build the application.

Example: The implementation view would show how the different software components, like the front-end interface and the back-end server, work together.

**- Process View:** Describes the non-functional aspects of the design, such as how the system handles concurrency and synchronization. It helps integrators understand how the different parts of the system interact.

Example: The process view would show how multiple users can interact with the website simultaneously and how the system handles their requests.

**- Deployment View:** Focuses on the physical infrastructure and shows how the software is deployed on hardware. It helps deployment managers understand how to set up and maintain the system.

Example: The deployment view would show how the website is hosted on servers and how those servers are connected.

**- Use-Case View:** Describes the central functionality of the system through specific scenarios or use cases. It helps all stakeholders, including end users, understand the system's purpose and features.

Example: The use-case view would outline scenarios like searching for products, adding items to the cart, and completing a purchase.

By using the 4+1 view model , everyone involved in building the software can have a better understanding of how the system works from different perspectives. It helps in communication, identifying potential issues, and making sure the system meets the requirements of users and stakeholders.
## Decomposing and Modeling The System
To perform threat modeling, it's important to understand how a system works and how it interacts with its surroundings. Here are some steps to help you decompose and model the system:

1- Start by creating a high-level diagram that shows the flow of information in the system. Identify the different parts of the system, like applications or modules, and how they connect with each other.

2- Identify the trusted boundaries of the system. These are the points where the system interacts with external entities. For example, if you're looking at a website, the trusted boundary could be where the website interacts with user input.

3- Add actors to the diagram. Actors can be both internal and external entities that interact with the system. Internal actors could be users or administrators, while external actors could be attackers or other systems.

4- Define internal trusted boundaries within the system. These are the different security zones or compartments that have been designed to protect certain parts of the system.

5- Review the actors you identified earlier to make sure they align with the trusted boundaries and the overall system design.

6- Add information flows to the diagram. These represent how data or information moves between different parts of the system. For example, it could be the flow of user input from a web form to a database.

7- Identify the information elements and classify them based on your information classification policy. This means categorizing the information based on its sensitivity or importance. For example, personal user data may be classified as highly sensitive.

8- Where possible, add assets to the identified information flows. Assets are the valuable resources that need protection, such as databases, servers, or intellectual property. This helps you identify what needs to be safeguarded.
